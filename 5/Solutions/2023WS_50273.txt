Evaluation:  General Feedback 


Academic Scholarship (Citations and Writing):

Positive:
•  Scholarship done well, which includes:
      - citing - source of information and knowledge (e.g., software, equations, data)
      - citing - proper ordering within the written text (e.g., ...[1-2]...[3] and not ...[3-4]...[1]...)
•  Writing and communication done well, which includes:
      - sentences - clean, concise and clear (C^3)
      - sentences - complete written when appropriate (e.g., within Markdown cells, docstrings, f-string)

Neutral:
•  Scholarship done okay, but with a few issues in the following:
      - references - inconsistent formatting
•  Writing and communication done okay, but with a few issues in the following:
      - sentences - unclear

Negative:
•  Scholarship done poorly, which includes the following:
      - references - missing important information - for example, this might include title, year, author(s), publication source, accessed date
      - units - were not provided when needed
•  Writing and communication done poorly, which includes the following:
      - communication - create your own context description (e.g., do not copy it from the assignment)
      - communication - no or very little presentation of thoughts or ideas (e.g., context, solution meaning, decisions made)
      - context - poorly provided (e.g., background info, the problem)


Jupyter Notebooks:

Positive:
•  Notebook is done well, which includes the following:
      - cell structure - good usage to separate ideas (e.g., thoughts, tasks/subtasks, user-defined functions)
      - code cells - good separation of encode ideas

Negative:
•  Notebook was poorly done,  which includes the following:
      - cell structure - significant work is needed to better separate the ideas, tasks, subtasks, or thoughts
      - markdown cells - there are significant issue concerning the formatting of markdown cells (e.g., header, tables, font)
      - markdown cells - a significant lack of good, informative communication was seen in your solution

Additional Notes: 
  You should describe in markdowncells what you are doing


Code Formatting:

Positive:
•  Formatting done well, which includes:
      - blank lines - consistent and good usage
      - imports - libraries were alphabetized
      - imports - libraries were listed at the notebook's top
      - indentation - consistent and with 4 spaces
      - line length - properly done (i.e., not longer than 110 characters)
      - naming - descriptive, human readable objects/variables naming
      - spacing - consistent and correct usage
      - writing - clean, concise and clearly (C^3) written code

Additional Notes: 
  You can reference variables in f-Strings using {variableName}


User-defined Functions:

Negative:
•  Your user-defined functions had the following problems:
      - docstring - none provided for specifying context and usage
      - docstring - no statement about what the function does
      - docstring - no statement about what the input variables are
      - docstring - no statement about what the function returns
      - internal checks - none provided (e.g., 'if not isinstance')
      - main code - should be nested under the 'else' statement of the internal checking
      - type hinting - none provided


General Feedback:

Neutral:
•  Overall, your work done on this assignment was:
      - okay  - there is notable room for improvement

Negative:
•  The following were problems with your solutions:
      - ID - please provide your ID in a markdown cell at the notebook's top
      - data in context - there was no attempt in placing the computed data into context (e.g., a sentence)

Additional Notes: 
  You should comment your code using markdowncells and use docstrings to explain what a function does


 Assignment Specific Feedback 


NumPy Library:

Positive:
•  The following points were well done:
      - List function: using a list for the simulated values
      - NumPy function: using ndarrays for the simulated values
      - Both functions: correctly done
      - List function: correctly done
      - NumPy function: correctly done
      - Both functions: good performance
      - List function: good performance
      - NumPy function: good performance

Negative:
•  Your NumPy function does not make use of::
      - np.add
      - np.subtract
      - np.multiply
