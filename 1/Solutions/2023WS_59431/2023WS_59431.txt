Evaluation:  General Feedback 


Academic Scholarship (Citations and Writing):

Positive:
•  Scholarship done well, which includes:
      - units - input and output numbers have units (e.g. N, kJ, m/s, Hz)
•  Writing and communication done well, which includes:
      - sentences - clean, concise and clear (C^3)
      - sentences - complete written when appropriate (e.g., within Markdown cells, docstrings, f-string)

Negative:
•  No citation of information sources:
      - As a university student, you should be citing sources of knowledge. This is something that you will need to do for your thesis.

Additional Notes: 
  You should have used some sources to indicate where you got your Information from.


Jupyter Notebooks:

Positive:
•  Notebook is done well, which includes the following:
      - cell structure - good usage to separate ideas (e.g., thoughts, tasks/subtasks, user-defined functions)
      - cell structure - logical ordering and mixture of markdown and code cells
      - code cells - good separation of encode ideas

Neutral:
•  Notebook could be slightly improved, which includes the following:
      - markdown cells - some additional communication would have been more informative

Additional Notes: 
  Some subheadings would have made your Notebook more readable, but the overall structure is ok.


Code Formatting:

Positive:
•  Formatting done well, which includes:
      - blank lines - consistent and good usage
      - imports - libraries were alphabetized
      - imports - libraries were listed at the notebook's top
      - indentation - consistent and with 4 spaces
      - line length - properly done (i.e., not longer than 110 characters)
      - naming - descriptive, human readable objects/variables naming
      - spacing - consistent and correct usage
      - writing - clean, concise and clearly (C^3) written code

Additional Notes: 
  You should have printed your results in a F-string rather than pasting it into a Markdowncell


General Feedback:
