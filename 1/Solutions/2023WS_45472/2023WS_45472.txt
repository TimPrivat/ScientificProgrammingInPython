Evaluation:  General Feedback 


Academic Scholarship (Citations and Writing):

Positive:
•  Scholarship done well, which includes:
      - citing - source of information and knowledge (e.g., software, equations, data)
      - citing - proper ordering within the written text (e.g., ...[1-2]...[3] and not ...[3-4]...[1]...)
      - units - input and output numbers have units (e.g. N, kJ, m/s, Hz)
•  Writing and communication done well, which includes:
      - sentences - clean, concise and clear (C^3)
      - sentences - complete written when appropriate (e.g., within Markdown cells, docstrings, f-string)

Additional Notes: 
  All sources were clearly listed and referenced. Your sentences were also clear and concise.


Jupyter Notebooks:

Positive:
•  Notebook is done well, which includes the following:
      - cell structure - good usage to separate ideas (e.g., thoughts, tasks/subtasks, user-defined functions)
      - cell structure - logical ordering and mixture of markdown and code cells
      - code cells - good separation of encode ideas
      - markdown cells - good usage to communicate ideas, thoughts or workflow

Additional Notes: 
  Your Notebook was structured very well but, you could have used a little more spacing to make it more readable.


Code Formatting:

Positive:
•  Formatting done well, which includes:
      - blank lines - consistent and good usage
      - f-string - properly used
      - imports - libraries were alphabetized
      - imports - libraries were listed at the notebook's top
      - indentation - consistent and with 4 spaces
      - line length - properly done (i.e., not longer than 110 characters)
      - naming - descriptive, human readable objects/variables naming
      - spacing - consistent and correct usage
      - writing - clean, concise and clearly (C^3) written code

Additional Notes: 
  Nothing more to add :)
