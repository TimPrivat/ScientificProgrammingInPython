Evaluation:  General Feedback 


Academic Scholarship (Citations and Writing):

Positive:
•  Scholarship done well, which includes:
      - citing - source of information and knowledge (e.g., software, equations, data)
      - units - input and output numbers have units (e.g. N, kJ, m/s, Hz)
•  Writing and communication done well, which includes:
      - sentences - clean, concise and clear (C^3)
      - sentences - complete written when appropriate (e.g., within Markdown cells, docstrings, f-string)

Neutral:
•  Scholarship done okay, but with a few issues in the following:
      - citing - when possible cite peer-reviewed papers or academic books, not websites

Additional Notes: 
  You should reference your sources where they are used in the Notebook. Use [x] in the Text for this.


Jupyter Notebooks:

Positive:
•  Notebook is done well, which includes the following:
      - cell structure - good usage to separate ideas (e.g., thoughts, tasks/subtasks, user-defined functions)
      - cell structure - logical ordering and mixture of markdown and code cells
      - code cells - good separation of encode ideas
      - markdown cells - good usage to communicate ideas, thoughts or workflow

Additional Notes: 
  I really liked the structure of your Notebook, but i think a table of contents would have been nice.
  


Code Formatting:

Positive:
•  Formatting done well, which includes:
      - blank lines - consistent and good usage
      - f-string - properly used
      - indentation - consistent and with 4 spaces
      - line length - properly done (i.e., not longer than 110 characters)


User-defined Functions:

Positive:
•  Good use of the following:
      - isolating ideas to user-defined functions

Negative:
•  Your user-defined functions had the following problems:
      - docstring - none provided for specifying context and usage
      - internal checks - none provided (e.g., 'if not isinstance')
      - type hinting - none provided

Additional Notes: 
  You didn't use docstrings to explain what your functions do. You also didn't check if the User passed the right type nor did you typehint.


General Feedback:

Positive:
•  Overall, your work done on this assignment was:
      - good

Additional Notes: 
  Your notebook was ok, but id rather have seen you using a list to read all distances from and printing their corresponding energies with a loop. (You can use the zip function for that).
