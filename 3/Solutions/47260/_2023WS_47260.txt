Evaluation:  General Feedback 


Academic Scholarship (Citations and Writing):

Positive:
•  Scholarship done well, which includes:
      - citing - source of information and knowledge (e.g., software, equations, data)
      - citing - proper ordering within the written text (e.g., ...[1-2]...[3] and not ...[3-4]...[1]...)
      - units - input and output numbers have units (e.g. N, kJ, m/s, Hz)


Jupyter Notebooks:

Positive:
•  Notebook is done well, which includes the following:
      - cell structure - good usage to separate ideas (e.g., thoughts, tasks/subtasks, user-defined functions)
      - cell structure - logical ordering and mixture of markdown and code cells
      - code cells - good separation of encode ideas
      - markdown cells - good usage to communicate ideas, thoughts or workflow


Code Formatting:

Positive:
•  Formatting done well, which includes:
      - blank lines - consistent and good usage
      - f-string - properly used
      - imports - libraries were alphabetized
      - imports - libraries were listed at the notebook's top
      - indentation - consistent and with 4 spaces
      - line length - properly done (i.e., not longer than 110 characters)
      - naming - descriptive, human readable objects/variables naming
      - spacing - consistent and correct usage
      - writing - clean, concise and clearly (C^3) written code


User-defined Functions:

Positive:
•  Good use of the following:
      - docstring - providing context; stating what the function does
      - docstring - defining input objects
      - docstring - defining returned object(s)
      - isolating ideas to user-defined functions
      - optional parameters - nice idea to include them
      - type hinting

Negative:
•  Your user-defined functions had the following problems:
      - internal checks - none provided (e.g., 'if not isinstance')

Additional Notes: 
  You should have checked if the user passed the right type to your functions.


General Feedback:

Positive:
•  Overall, your work done on this assignment was:
      - excellent

Additional Notes: 
  You really did a very good job :)
  Just make sure to typecheck your functions.
